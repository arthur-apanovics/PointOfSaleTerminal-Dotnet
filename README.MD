# Hi
This is the main solution for the technical exercise.  
I hope everything is clear and makes sense, however, please don't hesitate to 
get in touch in case of any questions or comments.
# Tests
Unit tests should cover most of the "business logic" however I did not go into 
great detail when coming up with scenarios (not a real project, after all). 
# How to
Build the solution and run tests with the following command:
```bash
docker build . --progress=plain
```

We add `--progress=plain` so that the test runner details are not omitted 
from output.
